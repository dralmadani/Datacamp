'''
loc and iloc (2)
loc and iloc also allow you to select both rows and columns from a DataFrame. To experiment, try out the following commands in the IPython Shell. Again, paired commands produce the same result.

cars.loc['IN', 'cars_per_cap']
cars.iloc[3, 0]

cars.loc[['IN', 'RU'], 'cars_per_cap']
cars.iloc[[3, 4], 0]

cars.loc[['IN', 'RU'], ['cars_per_cap', 'country']]
cars.iloc[[3, 4], [0, 1]]

Print out the drives_right value of the row corresponding to Morocco (its row label is MOR)
Print out a sub-DataFrame, containing the observations for Russia and Morocco and the columns country and drives_right.

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out drives_right value of Morocco
print (cars.loc[['RU', 'MOR'],['country','drives_right']])

# Print sub-DataFrame
print (cars.iloc[[4,5],[1,2]])
